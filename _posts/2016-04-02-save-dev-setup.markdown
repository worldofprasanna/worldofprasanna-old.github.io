Suddenly one fine morning my mac didn t boot. I pressed the start button and waited for 5 mins, nothing happened. In panic, I pressed start button 2 more times but the effort gone in vain.

Anyhow its a company mac and for sure I would get another in a day or two, but the settings which I had there would be lost. Project related stuff are there in github, so fine. But my **bash settings, intellij live templates and all my utilities, apps** ... Everything oooosh... Gone.

But luckily it got started after 6 mins and something hit me hard about the necessity of taking up backup. There are lot of ways to setup dev machine:

1. Ansible scripts to provision dev machine (Geeky way)
2. Committing .files and settings to github
3. Using configuration tools such as `https://osxc.github.io/`

lot of ways are there. But the point is,

> its necessary to take backup and figure out a way to restore it, if you don t want to start everything from scratch.

So here i go, committing my . files to github,
